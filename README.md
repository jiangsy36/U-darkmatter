# CNN Image Segmentation

# Application of deep learning techniques to images collected with Charge Coupled Devices to search for Dark Matter

# This code is based on the code in https://github.com/aritzLizoain/CNN-Image-Segmentation/tree/master. I produce the pytorch version to study the dark matter detection in Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs).
