# CNN Image Segmentation

Application of deep learning techniques to images collected with Charge Coupled Devices to search for Dark Matter

This code is modified from https://github.com/aritzLizoain/CNN-Image-Segmentation/tree/master. I produce the pytorch version to study the dark matter detection from CCD images.

The basic training process can be found in Code/train_pytorch
